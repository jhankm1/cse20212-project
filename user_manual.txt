IV.) TECHNICAL NOTES

LIBRARIES: 
The SDL, SDL_image, SDL_mixer, and 
SDL_ttf libraries are all required to
compile and run this program. 

FILES:
The "game.h", "game.cpp", and 
"main.cpp" code files are required 
to compile and run this program.
Other required files include 
Airman.png, Boss.png, GameOver.bmp,
airforce.png, bullet.png, 
city_background.bmp, obstacles.png,
winscreen.png, new_af_song.wav.

HOW TO COMPILE/RUN:
This program can automatically be 
built and run with the required 
libraries and files by using the
the Makefile included. Just type 
"make" to compile. After compiling, 
the program can be run by typing 
"./game" into the console. To remove 
game files in order to make a clean 
compile, simply type "make clean" 
into the console.

KNOWN BUGS:
Jumping in-game can tend to be a bit
glitchy. Jump height, animation, and 
key response time may differ and/or
have slight lag depending on player 
positioning on the map, nearby objects,
and whether or not the player is moving.

Bullet detection can be somewhat 
unpredictable, especially at the start 
of a new level. Due to the bullets being
constantly updated, a bullet may appear 
immediately at the beginning of a new 
level, instantly killing a player. 
Instances of this have been reduced 
significantly, but are not completely
eliminated.

A very thin blue background may still 
exist around some of the sprites. The 
blue backround was color-keyed to be 
transparent, but apparently some pixels
just want to show their true colors.
