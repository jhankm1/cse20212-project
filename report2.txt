PART 3: Progress Report
---------------------------------------------------------------
A lot of time since our report last week has been spent with
LazyFoo's tutorials. So far, most of us are up through and 
fairly confident with the material in lesson 5. Additionally,
a good amount of time was used learning how to make sprites 
in various editors, testing editors, trying to make sprites,
failing at making sprites, and, finally, succeeding at making
sprites. 

Since we are all in Air Force ROTC, we decided to 
have some fun with our code demonstration for this week, and
have a sprite of a pilot in a flight suit standing at parade
rest. He comes to attention and saluting when the "up" arrow 
is pressed, while pressing down (or any other key) causes the
pilot to return to parade rest.

We learned some fairly frustrating lessons this week. Firstly,
we learned that the student machines will give an SDL error 
("video device not available") when attempting to run programs
after being logged in for too long. We think the login times 
out. Exiting and SSH'ing in again fixes this issue. We also 
discovered that creating sprites is a long and tedious process,
and should be left to the more artistic members of our group. 
Finally, we learned that SDL stacks requests in a sort of
queue, and unless you specifically request it, the screen is 
not cleared between events. Rather, more images are added to 
the display. Thus, you must either have images with full 
backgrounds (so that they completely cover the previous image),
or you must specifically request that the screen be cleared in
between loading new images.
